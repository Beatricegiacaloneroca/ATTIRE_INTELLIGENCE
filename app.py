# -------------------------------- MATCH MAKER --------------------------------

# STEPS OVERVIEW: 
    #¬†1) API SET UP (either user uploads their API or we approve ours to test)
    #¬†2) FUNCTION CREATION (to encode images and load style)
    #¬†3) INITIALIZE STREAMLIT (create simple website with Python) and ask user to upload a picture of their face AND the place where they are going, their age and other relevant attributes 
    #¬†4) CLAUDE(A) - IDENTIFY SEASONAL PALETTE --> With Claude cision (see Test_LLM_Reading_colors.py) and a guide we provide on PCA (See guide_to_color.txt), recognize the user season palette
    # 5) CLAUDE(B) - IDENTIFY THE CORRECT FOLDER --> Ask Claude to identify which folder is best for the situation (folders are divided by occasion such as party or office)
    #¬†6) CLAUDE(C) - COMBINE OUTPUTS OF C(A) AND C(B) TO FIND IDEAL OUTFIT --> Prompt to choose from the chosen folder the best image according to the PCA 
    #¬†7) USER HAS RECCOMENDATION
